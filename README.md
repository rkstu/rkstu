# Applied AI Engineer | AI Safety & Interpretability

## About Me

I'm an Applied AI Engineer focused on making autonomous systems safe before deployment rather than reacting after failures occur.

At DevRev, I observed autonomous agents achieving high task success rates while violating safety constraints in ways traditional monitoring missed. This experience shaped my research into detecting unsafe behavior through internal model representations rather than relying solely on outputs.

My work bridges production AI systems and safety research, investigating why current evaluation methods fail to surface critical safety violations in real-world deployments.

## Research Focus

- **Pre-execution safety detection** through internal activation monitoring to identify unsafe decisions before execution
- **Evaluation framework limitations** where high task success masks policy and safety violations in multi-step agent reasoning  
- **Interpretability for safety-critical systems** exposing shortcut learning and spurious correlations that undermine reliability
- **Adversarial robustness testing** for production AI systems facing schema changes and noisy data beyond standard benchmarks

## Current Work

Building agent safety evaluation systems at DevRev and extending robustness benchmarks for CRM agents through adversarial testing. Previously designed human-in-the-loop evaluation pipelines that improved prediction accuracy from 72% to 89% while maintaining oversight.
