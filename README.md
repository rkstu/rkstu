Rahul Kumar: AI Research Engineer | Agentic AI Safety & Interpretability
========================================================================

* * * * *

👋 **Hello, I'm Rahul.** I am an Applied AI Engineer and Researcher focused on building robust, auditable, and reliable autonomous systems for real-world deployment. My work is driven by the mandate for safe Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and responsible enterprise adoption.

My specialization lies at the intersection of deep learning execution and methodological rigor. I translate failure analysis from high-stakes enterprise settings into improved **evaluation frameworks** for the next generation of LLM agents.

🔬 Featured Work: From Applied Engineering to Foundational Safety
-----------------------------------------------------------------

My portfolio emphasizes technical rigor and a commitment to transparency, demonstrating the "unusual self-direction" sought by frontier labs.

### 1\. Agentic System Safety & Evaluation (DevRev Enterprise Experience)

This research direction emerged from observing agent failure patterns in high-stakes enterprise settings (DevRev).

-   **The Problem:** Existing, static evaluations do not capture the temporal and context-dependent errors that occur when multi-step agents struggle to balance tool execution with safety constraints over long-horizon tasks. I refer to this failure mode as **Instruction Safety Conflicts**.

-   **Contribution:** Developed systematic documentation and new **evaluation frameworks** that support reliable, accountable, and policy-aligned deployment of agentic systems. This work directly addresses the need for robust technical guardrails and responsible AI principles in cloud environments.

### 2\. Interpretability in Vision Transformers for Clinical Diagnosis

-   **Project:** Final year academic project focused on **Vision Transformers (ViT)** for Retinal Disease Diagnosis.

-   **Highlight:** The focus was not on raw performance, but on engineering systems that foster trust. I developed grayscale ViT models with **focused-attention mechanisms** to produce interpretable heatmaps, demonstrating an early commitment to **Explainable AI (XAI)** and clinically aligned model design.
